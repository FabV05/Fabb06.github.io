# Jenkins Penetration Testing Notes

## Overview
**Jenkins** is an open-source automation server widely used for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. It is Java-based and highly extensible via plugins, making it a high-value target during penetration tests. Exposed Jenkins instances frequently suffer from misconfigurations (e.g., no authentication, open registration, anonymous read access) or vulnerable plugins, leading to risks such as unauthorized access, credential dumping, remote code execution (RCE), and lateral movement. Gaining control of Jenkins can compromise entire build pipelines, steal secrets (API keys, SSH keys, cloud credentials), execute code on agents/nodes, or pivot deeper into the network.

Common attack surfaces: Web UI (default port 8080/TCP), inbound agent connections (default port 50000/TCP), CLI, Groovy Script Console, and plugin-specific endpoints.

## Exploitation Workflow Summary
```

1. Discovery & Reconnaissance ├─ Scan for ports 8080/TCP (web UI) and 50000/TCP (inbound agents) ├─ Fingerprint version via headers, /login page, or /cli └─ Enumerate paths (e.g., /configureSecurity, /pluginManager)
2. Enumeration & Misconfiguration Checks ├─ Check for anonymous access or open registration (/signUp) ├─ Enumerate plugins (/pluginManager/plugins), users (/people), nodes (/computer) ├─ Test default/weak credentials (admin:admin, etc.) └─ Probe security configuration (/configureSecurity/)
3. Initial Access ├─ No authentication → Direct access to Script Console or jobs ├─ Open registration → Create account → Escalate via job configuration ├─ Weak credentials → Login and exploit permissions └─ Unauthenticated vulnerabilities (e.g., legacy CVEs if unpatched)
4. Code Execution ├─ Admin/Script Console access → Groovy RCE ├─ Job configure/build permission → Inject shell commands in build steps ├─ Vulnerable plugins → Command injection (e.g., Git Parameter) └─ Agent-to-controller attacks → File read/RCE
5. Post-Exploitation ├─ Dump credentials/secrets (plugins, config files, AWS metadata) ├─ Pivot to agents/nodes for shells ├─ Persist via scheduled jobs or backdoored pipelines └─ Escalate via leaked cloud keys or lateral movement
