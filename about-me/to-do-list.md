***

### 🟣 Phase 5 — Advanced Training & Specialization (Mid–Late 2026)

#### MCRTP Bootcamp (PwnedLabs)

* [ ] Complete MCRTP Bootcamp
* [ ] Focus on detection, telemetry, and response trade-offs

***

#### Malware Development Track

* [ ] Windows Internals fundamentals
* [ ] PE file structure
* [ ] WinAPI basics
* [ ] Simple malware loaders
* [ ] Shellcode execution
* [ ] Basic obfuscation techniques

**Repo Requirements (`/malware-dev/`)**

* [ ] README per PoC
* [ ] Detection results (Defender / EDR)
* [ ] Trade-offs clearly documented

***

#### Research & Writing — LDAP Injection

* [ ] Review BlackHat 2008 LDAP Injection research
* [ ] Identify techniques still valid today
* [ ] Identify obsolete techniques
* [ ] Analyze LDAP Injection in modern Active Directory
* [ ] Develop updated PoCs
* [ ] Publish a modern technical paper or blog post

***

### 📚 Documentation & Reporting (Ongoing)

* [ ] Maintain structured Markdown notes (OSCP-style)
* [ ] Build reusable cheat sheets and playbooks
* [ ] Publish technical writeups when possible

***

### ⚫ Optional Elite Track

* [ ] **APTLabs** (HTB Expert Pro Lab)
* [ ] Publish advanced tooling or research

***

### ✅ Guiding Principles
