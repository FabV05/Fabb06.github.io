# ME!?

Hey, I’m Fabian. I’m deep into cybersecurity and currently focused on understanding the offensive side properly. My main goal is to move into malware development and become a very specialized red teamer.

I’m based in Costa Rica 🇨🇷 and I’m trying to get more involved in the community, learn from others, and keep sharpening my technical skills.
